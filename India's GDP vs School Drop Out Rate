# India's GDP vs Dropout rate

NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank of the Government of India; it provides strategic inputs to the central and the state governments to achieve various development goals. In the past, NITI Aayog has played an important role in initiatives such as Digital India, Atal Innovation Mission and various agricultural reforms and have designed various policies in education, skill development, water management, healthcare, etc. NITI Aayog was established to replace the Planning Commission of India, which used to follow a top-down model for policy making, i.e., it typically designed policies at the central level (such as the 5-year plans). On the other hand, NITI Aayog designs policies specific to the different states or segments of the economy.
There are two parts to this project. The first part analyzes and compares the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). Then the states are divided in to four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.) are analyzed
The second part analyzes to find out if the GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.
